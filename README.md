**The DevastMod website is a legacy website for the now-defunct game Devast.io. Created by a user named "Yamete", the website offered enhanced gameplay through the use of a script. The script allowed players to access powerful features such as the ability to build on roads and a vision hack, giving them an advantage over other players in the game. In addition to the script, the website also provided helpful guides and tips on how to use it to its full potential. Although Devast.io is no longer active, the DevastMod website remains as a testament to the game, the community that surrounded it, and the HypR Clan.**
